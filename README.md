# YSCEBlend
YSFlight Blender scripts maintained by the YSFlight Community Edition Development Committe (YSCEDC). Intended for compatibility with both YSCEDC DNMs and Stock YSFlight DNMs.

# Introduction
In 2011, Vincentweb released the Blender YSFlight Scripts ([Original Post](https://forum.ysfhq.com/viewtopic.php?style=5&t=2709), [Current Download Link](https://forum.ysfhq.com/viewtopic.php?t=9489)) which included scripts to support YSFlight Modding in Blender 2.49. These scripts have since been used to develop new aircraft and ground object models. Modern computers, graphics cards, drivers, and other advances in computing have made using Blender 2.49 challenging and often times not suportable with current users' computers. Therefore YSCEDC desires to migrate the functionality from Vincent's Blender Scripts to a newer version of Blender that is more compatible with the userbase. 

# Blender 3
Blender 3.X was identified as the target for a YSCE development tool as the Vincent's Blender scripts provided an all-in-one solution to model creation (mesh definition, painting, and animation). For compatibility and stability, (Blender 3.3.X)[https://www.blender.org/download/lts/3-3/] was selected.
